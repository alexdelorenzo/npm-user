# üè† Install `npm` packages as a user
After running this script, `npm` will install packages as your local user. The script will set up `npm` user directories for you, and then automatically add them to your `$PATH`.

You won't need `root` privileges because packages won't be installed at the system level:
```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
$ type yarn
yarn is /home/user/.npm-packages/bin/yarn
```

## Usage
Run the following:
```bash
$ curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexdelorenzo/npm-user/main/npm-user.sh" | bash
```

You can check out [the script's requirements here](#requirements).

### Options
The script takes 5 optional positional arguments:
  1. `root`: The root directory for `npm`. Default is `$HOME`.
  2. `shell`: Name of the shell to configure. Default is your running shell.
  3. `rc`: Shell configuration file. The script with automatically detect yours, or default to `$HOME/.profile`.
  4. `bin`: `npm`'s executable directory. Default is `$root/.npm-packages/bin`.
  5. `man`: Manpage directory for `npm`. Default is `$root/.npm-packages/share/man`.

### Passing options
If you want to set your `npm` path to `~/.local/.npm-packages`, instead of `~/.npm-packages`, and configure `zsh` to work  with it, you can run:
```bash
$ curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexdelorenzo/npm-user/main/npm-user.sh" \
    | bash -s "~/.local" "zsh"
```

### Confirming it works
Install a package with the global flag `-g` and then see where `npm` puts the files:
```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
$ type yarn
yarn is /home/user/.npm-packages/bin/yarn
```
